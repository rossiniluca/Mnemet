MNEMET aims to bring together researchers from three Italian universities. The research groups working on the project are:

## University of Trieste:

* [Prof. Roberta Pappad√†](https://deams.units.it/it/dipartimento/persone/personale-docente?q=it/node/17847) is an Associate professor of Statistics at the University of Trieste and she is the Principal Investigator of MNEMET. Her research interests lie in Copula-based modelling, Computational Statistics, Classification and clustering, Time series clustering, Machine learning algorithms, Discrimination detection, and Ensemble methods in unsupervised problems. She has published in leading peer-reviewed journals such as Statistics and Computing; Spatial Statistics; Fuzzy Sets and Systems.
  
* [Prof. Gaetano Carmeci](https://www.units.it/persone/index.php/from/abook/persona/4715) is an Associate professor of Econometrics at the University of Trieste. His research interests are in Bayesian and spatial econometrics; panel cointegration and forecasting of electricity prices. He has published in several journals such as the Journal of Macroeconomics, Journal of Risk and Insurance, Journal of Policy Modeling and Journal of Public Economic Theory.

* [Prof. Giovanni Millo](https://deams.units.it/it/dipartimento/persone/personale-docente?q=it/node/20120) is an Associate professor of Economic Statistics at the University of Trieste and previously Researcher at the Research Department of Assicurazioni Generali. His research interests are Panel Data Econometrics; Spatial Econometrics; Computational Econometrics and Statistics; and Insurance Economics. He has published in peer-reviewed journals such as the Journal of Applied Econometrics, Journal of Statistical Software, Journal of Spatial Econometrics and Journal of Risk and Insurance.
  
## University of Milan

* [Prof. Luca Rossini](https://rossiniluca.github.io/web/) is an Associate professor of Statistics at the University of Milan and a Senior Researcher at Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei. He is the Co-Principal Investigator and head of the local unit of the MNEMET project. His research interests span Bayesian inference; time series analysis and forecasting techniques; energy economics and novel nonlinear models. He has published in leading peer-reviewed journals such as the Journal of Business and Economic Statistics; Journal of Econometrics; International Journal of Forecasting and Annals of Applied Statistics.

* [Prof. Andrea Bastianin](https://sites.google.com/view/andrea-bastianin) is an Associate professor of Economic Policy at the University of Milan and Program Director at Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei. His research interests are Time Series Econometrics, Environmental and Energy Economics, Forecasting techniques, and Critical raw materials. He has published in peer-reviewed journals such as Energy Economics; Macroeconomic Dynamics; Energy Policy and Economic Modelling.

* [Andrea Viselli](https://andreaviselli.github.io/about/) is a Post-Doctoral researcher in Econometrics interested in time series models, nowcasting, and forecasting evaluation. He is finishing his Ph.D. at the University of Milan and Pavia under the supervision of Prof. Fabrizio Iacone and Prof. Luca Rossini.  

  
## Free University of Bozen-Bolzano:

* [Prof. F. Marta L. Di Lascio](http://www.fmldilascio.it) is an Associate professor of Statistics at Free-University of Bozen-Bolzano. She is head of the local unit of the MNEMET project. Her research interests span among stochastic models with copulas, clustering techniques for complex dependent data, and statistical methods for high-dimensional spatial, time series, and panel data. She has published in different peer-reviewed journals such as Biometrics, Computational Statistics and Data Analysis,  Spatial Statistics, Journal of Classification, and  Journal of Banking and Finance.

* [Dr. Selene Perazzini](https://www.unibz.it/de/faculties/economics-management/academic-staff/person/45071-selene-perazzini) is a researcher in statistics, with primary interests in the statistical modelling of spatio-temporal data for environmental risk analysis. She holds a Ph.D. from the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, where her research centred on georeferenced data analysis, with applications to public-private insurance for natural risks and disaster risk management. She currently holds a research assistant position at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, contributing to the development of innovative techniques for analysing multivariate environmental time series with complex temporal and cross-sectional dependencies.
