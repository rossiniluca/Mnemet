MNEMET aims to bring together researchers from three Italian universities. The research groups working on the project are:

## University of Trieste:

* [Roberta Pappad√†](https://deams.units.it/it/dipartimento/persone/personale-docente?q=it/node/17847) is an Associate professor of Statistics at the University of Trieste and she is the Principal Investigator of MNEMET. Her research interests lie in Copula-based modelling, Computational Statistics, Classification and clustering, Time series clustering, Machine learning algorithms, Discrimination detection, and Ensemble methods in unsupervised problems. She has published in leading peer-reviewed journals such as Statistics and Computing; Spatial Statistics; Fuzzy Sets and Systems.
  
* [Gaetano Carmeci](https://www.units.it/persone/index.php/from/abook/persona/4715) is an Associate professor of Econometrics at the University of Trieste. His research interests are in Bayesian and spatial econometrics; panel cointegration and forecasting of electricity prices. He has published in several journals such as the Journal of Macroeconomics, Journal of Risk and Insurance, Journal of Policy Modeling and Journal of Public Economic Theory.

* [Giovanni Millo](https://deams.units.it/it/dipartimento/persone/personale-docente?q=it/node/20120) is a tenure-track Assistant professor of Business Statistics at the University of Trieste and previously Researcher at the Research Department of Assicurazioni Generali. His research interests are Panel Data Econometrics; Spatial Econometrics; Computational Econometrics and Statistics; and Insurance Economics. He has published in peer-reviewed journals such as the Journal of Applied Econometrics, Journal of Statistical Software, Journal of Spatial Econometrics and Journal of Risk and Insurance.
