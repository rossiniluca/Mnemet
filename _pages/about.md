MNEMET is the acronym for *“Modelling Non-standard data and Extremes in Multivariate Environmental Time series (MNEMET)”*(grant 20223CEZSR) funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research under the PRIN.

MNEMET brings together researchers from
* University of Trieste (PI: [Roberta Pappadà](https://deams.units.it/it/dipartimento/persone/personale-docente))
* University of Milan (Co-PI and Head of the local unit [Luca Rossini](https://rossiniluca.github.io/web//))
* Free University of Bozen-Bolzano (Head of the local unit [F. Marta L. Di Lascio](http://www.fmldilascio.it/))

Brief description of the proposal
======

The increasing interest of the scientific community in developing methods to assess climate change and its impacts on the natural and human systems poses new challenging tasks in modern statistics. The newest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released on February 28, 2022, highlights that severe climate change impacts are already happening and, in particular, extreme events have become more frequent and intense.
Multivariate statistical modelling can provide a fundamental contribution to environmental research, by allowing the description of complex interactions between the involved variables, where a major focus is on the occurrence of extremes. Following the indications of the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations ([https://sdgs.un.org/goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals)) and, in particular, of Goal 13 "Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts", our proposal aims to investigate some challenging aspects of temporal and spatial modelling, concerning with specific features of environmental data.
